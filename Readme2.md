User Story: Upgrade Initial Load Process

Why (Business Value & Need)

The current initial load process takes significant time and resources, making it inefficient for large-scale data ingestion. By upgrading the process using Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture, we can:

Improve performance by optimizing execution time.

Reduce errors with better validation and error handling.

Ensure scalability for handling growing data volumes.

Optimize resource utilization to balance cost and performance.


What (Scope & Expected Outcome)

We need to enhance the initial data load pipeline by:

1. Optimizing execution time for processing millions of records.


2. Implementing error handling at different pipeline stages.


3. Designing a structured folder strategy aligned with Bronze-Silver-Gold.


4. Executing business rules efficiently (full & partial runs).


5. Ensuring monitoring & logging for better insights into processing.



How (Implementation Approach)

1. Bronze Layer:

Store raw data as-is before transformations.

Implement schema validation and basic quality checks.

Maintain error logs for tracking ingestion issues.



2. Silver Layer:

Apply transformation rules to clean and structure data.

Implement deduplication, standardization, and validation.

Optimize processing with Z-ordering and partitioning.



3. Gold Layer:

Execute full business rules twice and partial rules twice.

Optimize execution by reducing redundant processing.

Prepare final, analytics-ready data for reporting.



4. Performance & Optimization:

Scale Databricks clusters dynamically based on load size.

Use Delta Lake for ACID transactions and versioning.

Implement logging and monitoring for execution tracking.

This approach ensures a faster, scalable, and optimized initial load with structured error handling and efficient resource utilization. Would you like a breakdown of tasks for execution?
